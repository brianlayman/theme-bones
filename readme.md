# WARNING
In May 2018, the domain themble.com was sniped from under Eddie Machado when it was up for renewal. He says in a tweet:   
   "Basically, my domains were scooped when they lapsed and now they have bones setup pointed to a fake account impersonating me:
   https://themble.com/bones/ 
   https://github.com/eddiemachado-zz/
   Both domain and github account are not me." src: https://twitter.com/eddiemachado/status/991737785475305472
   
This repository is a fork off of squibbleFish/theme-bones which was a fork of the eddiemachado-zz repo which was forked from eddiemachado/bones.  There were two commits added since eddiemachado's last true commit. Both of these have been undone and you can look at the commit log to verify that, outside of this readme file, this is a clean copy of eddiemachado's work. This repository will be kept as-is with no alterations for those who wish a clean copy of Bones.
